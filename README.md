# V4PCS
---
## Intro
Based on Super4PCS algorithm, but it uses tetrahedral 4 points instead of planar 4 points. This will significantly decrease the number of extracted congruent pointsets, and may decrease the time cost of CSV(Congruent Set Verification), which is the most time-consuming part of Super4PCS.
